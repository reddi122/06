The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for developing software that ensures high quality and efficiency. It consists of several stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the software development process. Here's an overview:

1. Requirement Analysis
Objective: Gather and analyze business and technical requirements.
Activities:
Identify stakeholders and gather requirements.
Document requirements in an SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document.
Define project scope and objectives.
Key Output: SRS document.
2. Planning
Objective: Create a roadmap for the project.
Activities:
Define resources, timelines, and budget.
Identify risks and mitigation strategies.
Choose technology stack and tools.
Key Output: Project plan.
3. System Design
Objective: Design the architecture and detailed solution.
Activities:
Create high-level and detailed designs (HLD and LLD).
Define data flow, system architecture, and user interfaces.
Prepare prototypes or wireframes.
Key Output: Design documents.
4. Implementation (Development)
Objective: Build the software based on design specifications.
Activities:
Write code according to the defined requirements and design.
Perform unit testing during development.
Key Output: Source code and working modules.
5. Testing
Objective: Ensure the software is free of defects and meets requirements.
Activities:
Conduct various testing types (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing).
Log, fix, and retest bugs.
Key Output: Test cases, defect reports, and a validated software product.
6. Deployment
Objective: Deliver the software to the production environment.
Activities:
Deploy the software in a live environment.
Provide user training and documentation.
Set up monitoring and support systems.
Key Output: Deployed software.
7. Maintenance
Objective: Ensure the software continues to meet user needs.
Activities:
Monitor performance and resolve issues.
Implement enhancements and updates.
Address security vulnerabilities.
Key Output: Updated and maintained software.
SDLC Models
Common SDLC models include:

Waterfall Model (linear and sequential).
Agile Model (iterative and collaborative).
Spiral Model (risk-focused).
V-Model (verification and validation).
Iterative Model (incremental improvements).
